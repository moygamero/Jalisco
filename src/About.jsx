                            Allow me to introduce Norma and Jose, the passionate owners of Viva Jalisco, a typical  Mexican restaurant located in Bothell, Washington. Hailing from Tototlán, Jalisco, they bring with them the rich cultural heritage of this enchanting region, known as the cradle of Mexican culture.
                            <br />
                            Jalisco, the birthplace of tequila, mariachi music, and charrerias, has a deep-rooted tradition of celebrating life and embracing its unique flavors. Norma and Jose's journey from Tototlán to Bothell is a testament to their love for sharing the authentic taste of their homeland with the local community.
